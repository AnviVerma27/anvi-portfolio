          <h3>Unsupervised Neural Network Models</h3>
          <p><strong>GeeksForGeeks</strong>, Oct 19, 2023</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/unsupervised-neural-network-models/">Unsupervised learning</a> is an intriguing area of machine learning that reveals hidden structures and patterns in data without requiring labelled samples. Because it investigates the underlying relationships in data, itâ€™s an effective tool for tasks like anomaly identification, dimensionality reduction, and clustering. In this article, I have discussed it in detail.</p>

          <h3>Feature Descriptor in Image Processing</h3>
          <p><strong>GeeksForGeeks</strong>, Oct 12, 2023</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/feature-descriptor-in-image-processing/">In image processing</a>, a feature descriptor is a representation of an image region or key point that captures relevant information about the image content. In this article, I have discussed one of the image processing algorithms i.e. Feature Descriptor.</p>

          <h3>OpenCV: Image Processing</h3>
          <p><strong>Medium</strong>, July 29, 2023</p>
          <p><a href="https://medium.com/@anviver2005/opencv-image-processing-ca2b5186589e">OpenCV</a> stands for Open-source Computer Vision, which is made available by Berkely Software Distribution license. It is basically a group of algorithms inspired by human brain that learn using large number of datasets so as to clone the human instincts.</p>
